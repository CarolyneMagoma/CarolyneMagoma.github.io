# simple home network

<b>guide question<b>

Design a network in CISCO packet tracer to connect two departments through the following:
- each department should contain atleast two pcs
- appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
- using the given network address 192.168.40.0, all interfaces should be configured with appropriate ip addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
- All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cable.
- Test the connectivity between the two departments -pcs in one department should be able to ping the pcs in other departments.



An Inter-VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical network segment that allows network administrators to partition a single physical network into multiple smaller networks.
