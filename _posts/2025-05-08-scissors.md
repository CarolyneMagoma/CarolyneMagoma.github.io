# Scissors Challenge Write-up – BitCTF

<b>Challenge description.<b>

A long, seemingly encrypted string was provided. Our task was to uncover the hidden message

<b>Initial Analysis – Cipher Identification<b>     

The encrypted string appeared to be a non-standard format. To start, I used an online Cipher Identifier tool (such as dcode.fr) to determine the type of encoding used. The tool suggested it could be Base62 encoding.

<b>Decoding Base62<b>   

Upon decoding the cipher using a Base62 decoder, I obtained this intermediate message:    

Av aol vul dov mpukz aopz zjyvss, ruvd aoha dpzkvt splz pu aol jvkl: IpaJAM{zljylaz_vm_aol_jhlzhy}.
Zopma aol slaalyz aopyallu aptlz, hz aol hujpluaz vujl kpk.

It was still not plain English but clearly looked like a substitution cipher

<b>Applying ROT Cipher (Caesar Shift)<b>     

This looked like a ROT13 (Caesar cipher with a shift of 13). Applying a ROT13 decoder revealed the final plaintext message 
To the one who finds this scroll, know that wisdom lies in the code: BitCTF{secrets_of_the_caesar}.
Shift the letters thirteen times, as the ancients once did.

Thank you!!!.      

 Happy hacking, Happy hanting.
