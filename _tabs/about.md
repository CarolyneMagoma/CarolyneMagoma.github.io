# Introduction

Hello! I'm Carolyne Magoma, a passionate and ambitious tech enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cloud Computing and Information Security at Machakos University.

With hands-on experience as a Network Engineer Intern, I've developed strong skills in configuring routers, switches, IP phones, and performing cable terminations. I'm particularly interested in building secure, scalable networks and exploring the intersection of cloud technologies and cybersecurity.

This blog is a space where I share my tech journey, document my projects, and provide insights into networking, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Whether you're a fellow student, a professional, or just curious about tech â€” welcome aboard!
